Each Cloud Service has a DNS name <cloudservice>.cloudapp.net 
A DNS name is updated when the IP Changes
VIP is just a PIP(Public IP) assigned to a loadbalancer rather than a VM (actual VM)
It is possible to reserve static VIP to keep even if the service is de-provisioned or provisioned

The cloud service VIP us used to provide access to VM services through endpoints
Endpoints enable a port on the VIP to be mapped to a port for VM or a group of VMs

Every VM in a cloud service could communicate to all other VMs via DIP in the same cloud service but not outside cloud service  except via VIPs or endpoints

There is no way to specify IP from VMs just using cloud service networking

Name resolution in cloud service
    Azure DNS is exclusively used for native cloud service name resolution
    provides a dynamic dns capability enabling all VMs in the same cloud service to perform name resolution on all other VMs in the same cloud service
    Internet DNS resolution is also provided.

There are charges for egress (unless using an unmetered Express Route Connection) from an Azure Data Center

Virtual Netwrok 
    construct created in azure
    lives within a subscription and region
    has one or more ip ranges associated with it
    DNS servers can be configured that will be configured as part of DHCP offer
    subnets are created to break up the network range
    by default all machines within a virtual network can communicate
    4096 private ips per virtual network
    Azure DNS can be used which provide the name resolution for alll services within the virtual network
    DNS server can be explicitly configured such as domain controller
    VMs in  Azure always get their IP configuration via DHCP and never static configuration
    VMs must be restarted to get updated dns configuration
    when a vm is reprovisioned to the fabric it gets a new VM-nic and possibly a new IP
    static ips can be assigned via AZ fabric using pwsh or portal
    create a separate subnet as a pool for static ip assignment

Traffic flow within a virtual network
    By default
        VM in a VNET can communicate with every other VM in every subnet in the same virtual network
        Anything on Internet (Outbound)
        Anything connected via VPN or express route

Network security groups
    Enables rules to be created then assigned to network security group
    NSG can be applied to a subnet or VMs
    When applied to subnet it is still enforced at the vmNic. Its not an edge device.
    Rules are based on 5-Tuple and have priority and action(allow or deny)
        Source IP Address(Can be range)
        Source Port
        Destinate IP Address
        Desrtination Port
        Protocol (TCP, UDP, or *)

        Specifial Tags
            VIRTUAL_NETWORK - Any address space of teh virtual network and also VNETs it is connected to (On-Premise network)
            AZURE_LOADBALANCER - az infrastructure LB
            INTERNET - IP Address space external to Virtual Network
    1 NSG can be applied to all subnets
    
Network Interface    
    By Default - a VM has a single NIC
    Depending on the size of the VM multiple NIC may be allowed
    NIC must be added at the time of provisioning
    Cannot mix single NIC and multiple NIC vms in the same availability set
    VM NICs can be in the same subnet or different subnet(Designed for virtual appliance)

User Defined Routes
    Enables Modification default routing packets
    Example - adding a firewall/IDS appliance that all Traffic should flow through


    Non - Internet routable IP ranges
        10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
        172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
        192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168 prefix)

// Enabling External access
ARM 
    - Private IP - Assigned to VM, Internal Load Balanacer and application gateway
    - Public IP - Communication from Internet
        - Assigned to Internet facing loadbalancer, VPN gateway and application gateways
    - Can be static or dynamic
    - Public IP - resource within a specific region
    - DNS - <DNS Label>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com
Load Balancers -
    Provides distribution of requests to multiple targets. This enables ability to scale and resiliency from service failure.
    Internet Facing Load Balancers 
        - Balances incoming traffic from the internet to VMs in Azure
    Internal Load Balanacer
        - Balances traffic between VMs in a virtual network ( or connected network)
    Works at Layer 4 
        - 2 types of services
            Hash based distribution (5 Tuples)
            Port forwarding
LoadBalancer stickiness
    - By default uses 5 Tuples
    - Can also use 2 or 3 Tuples (Source and Destination IP)
        - Source IP (2 Tuple) - source and destination ip only
        - source ip protocol (3 Tuples) - As above but also protocol

    // Need to create PWSH script for loadbalancer
Traffic Manager 
    Requirements to balance requests based on proximity to the requesting user, round-robin or failure
    Traffic Manager provides a DNS based distribution service for incoming DNS requests
    Targets can be VMs in Azure, PaaS, other traffic manager, and on premise services
Hybrid Cloud Requirements
    Cross-cloud management 
    Single provisioning system
    Network Connectivity
Routing between Azure and on-premise networks
    - Must use unique IP address ranges
    - Not possible to route between networks that uses the same IP scheme
        - Includes on-premise to AZ
        - Az VN to Az VN
    VMs cannot moved between VN without deleting and recreating
    Azure Site to Site VPN provides connectivity between a virtual network and an on-premise network or another virtual network.
    To on-premises connects over the internet
    Uses IPSec/IKE to encrypt traffic 
    VPN Gateway created in Az as automatically created pair of VMs(hidden) in active-passive configuration
    On premises compatible gateway device requirement
VPN Gateway Subnet
    To enable site-to-site VPN -> You need a Gateway -> and this needs a gateway subnet
    can use /29 but recommended to use /27 to enable support for S2S and express route gateway co-existence
    Common when creating subnets in new VNet is to leave an address space at the start to use for the gateway
    Do not use NSG for gateway subnet
    The name has to be GatewaySubnet
Types of VPN Gateway
